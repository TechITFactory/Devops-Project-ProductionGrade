Summary,Issue Type,Issue ID,Parent,Description
"Epic 1: Course Foundation",Epic,E1,,"PROBLEM: Most teams fail due to bad Git hygiene - direct pushes to main, missing code reviews, no CI gates. APPROACH: Adopt Trunk-Based Development with 3 separate repos (Infra/App/GitOps)."
"Create 3 production repos (Infra/App/GitOps)",Story,S1.1,E1,"Create techitfactory-infra (Terraform), techitfactory-app (Microservices), techitfactory-gitops (ArgoCD manifests). Each repo needs README with prerequisites."
"Enforce Trunk-Based Development rules",Story,S1.2,E1,"Configure GitHub branch protections: main protected, PR required, no direct push. Add CODEOWNERS file."

"Epic 5: Ingress + Domain",Epic,E5,,"PROBLEM: K8s Services are internal. Need HTTPS + custom domain. APPROACH: ALB Controller + ACM + Route53."
"Install ALB Controller (IRSA)",Story,S5.1,E5,"Deploy AWS LB Controller. Verify Ingress creates ALB."
"Configure Route53 + TLS",Story,S5.2,E5,"ACM cert for techitfactory.com. Route53 A record. Verify HTTPS works."
"Epic 6: ArgoCD Bootstrap",Epic,E6,,"PROBLEM: Manual kubectl is unauditable. APPROACH: GitOps with ArgoCD. App-of-Apps pattern."
"Install ArgoCD (Helm)",Story,S6.1,E6,"Install ArgoCD via Helm. Expose UI via ingress."
"Bootstrap App-of-Apps",Story,S6.2,E6,"Create root Application pointing to GitOps repo. Child apps auto-sync."
"Create Argo Projects (dev/prod)",Story,S6.3,E6,"Create namespaces and Argo Projects with blast-radius control."
"Epic 7: Observability",Epic,E7,,"PROBLEM: Need metrics, logs, dashboards. APPROACH: PLG stack (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana)."
"Deploy kube-prometheus-stack",Story,S7.1,E7,"Deploy via GitOps. Expose Grafana via ingress."
"Deploy Loki",Story,S7.2,E7,"Deploy Loki. Configure Grafana datasource."
"Epic 8: Walking Skeleton App",Epic,E8,,"PROBLEM: Platform is empty. APPROACH: 4 polyglot services - /health, /ready, non-root Docker, Helm."
"Create monorepo structure",Story,S8.1,E8,"Create /services/frontend, product, cart, order with health endpoints."
"Create Dockerfiles",Story,S8.2,E8,"Multi-stage, non-root, <100MB images."
"Create Helm charts",Story,S8.3,E8,"Deployment + Service + probes for each service."
"Expose dev entrypoint",Story,S8.4,E8,"Ingress routes for frontend and APIs. Smoke test."
"Epic 9: CI/CD",Epic,E9,,"PROBLEM: Manual build doesn't scale. APPROACH: GitHub Actions + SonarCloud + Trivy + GitOps."
"Per-service GitHub Actions",Story,S9.1,E9,"Workflows for lint, test, Trivy scan, DockerHub push."
"Integrate SonarCloud",Story,S9.2,E9,"Quality gates in PR. Document policy."
"Dev auto-deploy on merge",Story,S9.3,E9,"Merge to main updates GitOps repo. ArgoCD auto-syncs."
"Prod promotion via Release/Tag",Story,S9.4,E9,"GitHub Release triggers prod deployment."
"Epic 10: Daily Build & Destroy",Epic,E10,,"PROBLEM: AWS costs add up. APPROACH: One-command make up/down. <20 min target."
"Create make up/down scripts",Story,S10.1,E10,"Idempotent scripts for full platform lifecycle."
"Capture boot-time metrics",Story,S10.2,E10,"Time each stage. Document optimization levers."
