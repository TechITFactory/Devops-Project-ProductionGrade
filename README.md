# E-Commerce Microservices Platform

> A Production-Grade DevOps Course Project

## About This Project

You have just joined **ShopFast Inc.** as a DevOps Engineer. The company has a working e-commerce application, but it's a mess:
- No CI/CD
- No Kubernetes
- Deployments are manual
- "It works on my machine" is the motto

**Your mission:** Transform this codebase into a production-ready platform over the next 6 sprints.
