# Agile Guide for DevOps Teams

## What is Agile?

Agile is an iterative approach to project delivery. Instead of one big "waterfall" release, we deliver value in small, frequent increments called **Sprints**.

---

## Key Concepts

### Sprint
A fixed timebox (usually 2 weeks) where the team commits to delivering a set of features.

### Epic
A large body of work that spans multiple sprints.
*Example:* "CI/CD Pipeline" is an Epic containing many stories.

### User Story
A feature described from the user's perspective.
*Format:* "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]."

### Task
A technical work item under a story.
